# In python we use '#' symbole for comment a line.
# The '#' is used for a single line comment.

print("Hello World !!! ")   #The print function is used for display the result

# This is single line comment and it will not execute.
# print("Hello !!!") 

''' This is
multi line comment 
print("Hey ")
print("This line will not execute")
'''

#in python there is no multi line comment but we can use it by using triple quotes ''' in starting of comment and at ending at comment '''

print("For comment a sigle line we can use # ")
print("For a multiple line comment we can use triple single ''' or dual quotes in starting and ending of comment ")
print("""Triple quotes are basically used for initilizing a multi line string into a variable with the written formate.
Because we not assigned it into any variable so it got ignored.""")

# If you wanna do comment any line of program then you have to use '#'
# If you just wanna wrote a documentation of a program then you can use "" or '' this can use for single line comment.
"Hey This line will not Execute Because this line is not assigned into any variable so it will works as a comment too."
# I can't prefer you to use above single or dual quote for comment because it's not good.
# I'm just telling you to have knowledge about it too. Maybe you know it from before too.
# In python there is only single line comment symbole is available which is '#' so you have to used only this.
