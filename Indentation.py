# In python we used indentation to tell that the code is inside a block of any function or statement.
# For indentation we can use minimum one space or maximum any number of space.
# Remember you have to give same number of space to indent each line which line you want to make inside a block on condition or parameter.
# For Example if you have given 2 space to the first line of the code which is inside the function or condition.
# Then you have to give 2 space to each line of code which you wann make inside that conditional statement or function.
# For usiversal people use a tab space means 4 space or 8 space to make code readable.
# Indentation tells that the code is inside the block.
# Example :

a = 10
if a >= 1 :
    print(a)        # This line have a tab space to tell that this line is inside the block of if condition.
    a = a - 1       # This line have a tab space to tell that this line is inside the block of if condition.

print("Hello !!! ") # This line is not indented so it is not inside the block of if condition.
for i in range(10):
 print(i)           # In this I have given one space for indentation to tell the program that this line is inside the for loop.
 i = i + 1          # In this I have given one space for indentation to tell the program that this line is inside the for loop.
